# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository contains the Requirement Analysis project for a booking management system. The project aims to create a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.This project will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase, simulating a real-world development scenario.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that focuses on defining, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software system. It involves a systematic approach to gathering, analyzing, and specifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
During Requirement Analysis, stakeholders' needs and expectations are gathered through various techniques, such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation. The gathered requirements are then analyzed, refined, and documented in a clear and concise manner.

The importance of Requirement Analysis cannot be overstated.

* It ensures that the software system meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations
* Reduces the risk of project failure due to misunderstood or missing requirements
* Saves time and resources by identifying and addressing potential issues early on
* Improves communication among stakeholders, developers, and testers
* Provides a clear foundation for the design, development, testing, and maintenance of the software system

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that focuses on defining, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software system. It involves a systematic approach to gathering, analyzing, and specifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC for several reasons:
1. Prevents Project Failure
Requirement Analysis helps prevent project failure by ensuring that the software system meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations. By gathering and documenting requirements accurately, developers can avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications that can lead to project failure.
2. Reduces Costs and Saves Time
Requirement Analysis saves time and resources by identifying and addressing potential issues early on. By detecting defects and ambiguities in the requirements phase, developers can avoid costly rework and delays during the development and testing phases.
3. Improves Communication and Collaboration
Requirement Analysis improves communication and collaboration among stakeholders, developers, and testers. By providing a clear and concise documentation of the requirements, all parties involved can share a common understanding of the project's objectives and scope.
