# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository contains the Requirement Analysis project for a booking management system. The project aims to create a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.This project will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase, simulating a real-world development scenario.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that focuses on defining, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software system. It involves a systematic approach to gathering, analyzing, and specifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
During Requirement Analysis, stakeholders' needs and expectations are gathered through various techniques, such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation. The gathered requirements are then analyzed, refined, and documented in a clear and concise manner.

The importance of Requirement Analysis cannot be overstated.

* It ensures that the software system meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations
* Reduces the risk of project failure due to misunderstood or missing requirements
* Saves time and resources by identifying and addressing potential issues early on
* Improves communication among stakeholders, developers, and testers
* Provides a clear foundation for the design, development, testing, and maintenance of the software system

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that focuses on defining, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software system. It involves a systematic approach to gathering, analyzing, and specifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC because it:
1. Prevents Project Failure
Requirement Analysis helps prevent project failure by ensuring that the software system meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations. By gathering and documenting requirements accurately, developers can avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications that can lead to project failure.
2. Reduces Costs and Saves Time
Requirement Analysis saves time and resources by identifying and addressing potential issues early on. By detecting defects and ambiguities in the requirements phase, developers can avoid costly rework and delays during the development and testing phases.
3. Improves Communication and Collaboration
Requirement Analysis improves communication and collaboration among stakeholders, developers, and testers. By providing a clear and concise documentation of the requirements, all parties involved can share a common understanding of the project's objectives and scope.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The following are the key activities involved in Requirement Analysis:

* Requirement Gathering: Identifying and collecting requirements from stakeholders, users, and other sources through various techniques, such as interviews, surveys, and workshops.
* Requirement Elicitation: Extracting and clarifying requirements from stakeholders and users through techniques like observation, brainstorming, and prototyping.
* Requirement Documentation: Recording and documenting the gathered and elicited requirements in a clear, concise, and organized manner using tools like requirement management software.
* Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Examining and analyzing the documented requirements to identify relationships, dependencies, and potential issues, and creating models like use case diagrams and data flow diagrams to visualize the requirements.
* Requirement Validation: Verifying and validating the requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, accurate, and meet the stakeholders' needs and expectations, and obtaining formal approval from stakeholders.

# Types of Requirements

Requirements can be categorized into two main types:

Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements define what the system should do, describing the system's behavior, functionality, and interactions with users and other systems.
* The system shall allow users to search for available rooms based on dates and room type.
* The system shall enable users to book a room and provide payment details.
* The system shall send a confirmation email to the user upon successful booking.
* The system shall allow administrators to manage room inventory and pricing.

Non-Functional Requirements
Non-Functional Requirements describe how the system should behave, focusing on quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.
* The system shall respond to user queries within 24hours.
* The system shall ensure the security and confidentiality of user data.
* The system shall be accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
* The system shall be available 24/7, with a maximum downtime of 1 hour per month.

# Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that visualizes the interactions between users and the system. They help to:
(1) Identify the system's functional requirements
(2)Model the system's behavior
(3)Communicate the system's functionality to stakeholders

# Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

(1)Improve understanding of the system's requirements
(2)Enhance communication among stakeholders and developers
(3)Identify potential issues and dependencies
(4)Provide a foundation for system design and testing

# Use Case Diagram for the Booking System

Actors:
* User
* Administrator
* Payment Gateway
* 
Use Cases:
* Search for available rooms
* Book a room
* Make payment
* Manage room inventory
* View booking history

# Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software system or application must meet to satisfy the stakeholders' needs and expectations. They are used to verify that the system meets the specified requirements and works as expected.

# Importance of Acceptance Criteria
* Ensures that the system meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations
* Provides a clear understanding of what the system should do and how it should behave
* Helps to identify and address potential issues early on
* Enables effective testing and validation of the system
* 
# Example of Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature
* The system shall display the booking summary, including room details, dates, and total cost.
* The system shall allow the user to enter payment details, including credit card number, expiration date, and security code.
* The system shall validate the payment details and display an error message if the details are invalid.
* The system shall process the payment and update the booking status to "Confirmed" upon successful payment.
* The system shall send a confirmation email to the user with the booking details and payment receipt.
* The system shall display a confirmation message to the user with the booking details and payment receipt.
  
# Benefits of Acceptance Criteria
* Ensures that the system meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations
* Provides a clear understanding of what the system should do and how it should behave
* Helps to identify and address potential issues early on
* Enables effective testing and validation of the system
  
By establishing and using acceptance criteria, developers can ensure that the system meets the specified requirements and works as expected, ultimately delivering a high-quality software system that meets the stakeholders' needs and expectations.
